# westelmcodechallenge

For this project I am using NodeJS in tandem with Express and EJS to consume the JSON at 

```bash
https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json
```

The details page lists all products found in 'GROUPS' and renders them on the page.  Details displayed using EJS.
