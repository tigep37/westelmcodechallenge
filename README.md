# westelmcodechallenge

For this project I am using NodeJS on the back end with Express for my web framework and EJS to display my view. Given the following JSON to consume -  

```bash
https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json
```

The details page lists all products found in 'GROUPS' and renders them on the page.  

To run the application you'll need Node installed.  Simply run 'node app.js' from the main directory to start the app.

I have built in some simple Mocha and Chai unit tests that are located in the tests/test.js file.  To run them run npm test from the command line.
